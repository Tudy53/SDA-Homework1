                                        First homework 1 DSA - HashTable


        Resolving the homework is based on inserting a word in a hash table (if we access the insert
command) and printing, depending on the command, information from table hash(using print_function).
        Insert_function devides the line (the command given by the user) in the words needed and then
inserts them into the hash table using 'insertWordTH' function. It checks the word's first letter gives
the word a position in a specific list (for instance, if a word starts with 'b', which is the second letter
of the alphabet, we will insert the word in v[2] list) and, calling Ins_Word, we do the placement.
        We place the word in a 'cell', the structure containing as info the word and its number of characters.
Then, this cell in inserted in a list which becomes info (is InfoWord type) for an InfoNumberLetters sructure
(alocInfoNumberLetters). This structure is a cell for v[2] list (keeping the example given above).
        'InsInfoWord'assures that the InfoWord cell is placed properly in the InfoNumberLetters's info. The
InfoWord cells should be inserted according to specific criteria: descending by the number of appearances. In
case of identical number of appearances, we insert the cell in an ascending way, taking into account
lexicographically criteria.
